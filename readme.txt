you need to install flask before starting

pip install flask


extract flask_blog file
open terminal go to the flask_blog directory "the inner directory which contains routes.py"
run following two command
export FLASK_APP=routes.py
flask run

then got to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/"

exit button in the web app is for closing the database.

some time for running the above command you might need to close then open your terminal. 

I want to you, to tell me what modification we should do in our web app :)
